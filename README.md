# About
This is a restaurant application built using JavaScript Vue 3 for learning Vue3. The application has mainly been built using JavaScript, for the backend section where we are calling the apis, we haven't used any backend language or framework. We have used a package called a JSON-Server npm package simply called json-server that allows us to mimick a backend

##Running The Project 
First you will need to be in the working directory of the project where you will cd into it and run the normal npm run serve. From then on to activate the json-server backend You will need to open a separate terminal or cmd and cd into the project again from that separate terminal. From then you will need to run "json-server --watch db.json", without the quotes and this will activate the backend which will now run the api calls when required. 

From there your good to go.
